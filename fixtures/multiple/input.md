## Basic sequence diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>John: How about you John?
    Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
    Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

## Basic flowchart

    A --> C(Round Rect)
    B --> D{Rhombus}
    C --> D
```

## Loops, alt and opt

```mermaid
